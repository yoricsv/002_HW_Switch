*file* | README.md
*brief* |  A few months ago I made a program for the STM32F103x MCU, making a dynamic indication on a four-digit seven-segment display. Of course, creating a program in which I only use the switch operator is not interested, and I try to implement the same in C ++ for a console application.
*Note* | JUST FOR ME!!! > I wanna refactoring this code!!! (slit on the files)
